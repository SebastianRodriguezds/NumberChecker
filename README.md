Number Guessing Game
Description

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! In this game, the computer thinks of a random number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess what it is. Depending on the difficulty level you choose, you'll have a certain number of attempts to guess the correct number.

The game will give you clues after each guess:

    "Too high" if your guess is higher than the number.
    "Too low" if your guess is lower than the number.
    "Perfect" if you guess the number correctly.

How to Play

    When you start the game, you will be asked to choose a difficulty level.
        Easy: You have 10 attempts to guess the number.
        Hard: You have 5 attempts to guess the number.

    After selecting the difficulty level, the game will prompt you to make your first guess. Enter a number between 1 and 100.

    The game will tell you if your guess is too low, too high, or if you've guessed the number correctly.

    If you guess the number correctly, the game ends with a congratulatory message. If you run out of attempts, you lose the game.
